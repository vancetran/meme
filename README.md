# MemeKit

*An elegant meme tool for a more civilized age.*

This is an effort to rebuild [Meme-Gen](https://github.com/vancetran/meme-gen) from scratch to be more modular and themeable. Also, it's a great excuse to learn Angular and Snap.svg.

I'm developing in the open, so mind the dust â€“ this is not ready for public consumption yet. Head over to [Meme-Gen](https://github.com/vancetran/meme-gen) for something less sophisticated, but production-ready.

Draws inspiration from [CardKit](https://github.com/times/cardkit), [Vox's Meme](https://github.com/voxmedia/meme), and [Pixelcite](https://github.com/onyxfish/pixelcite).
