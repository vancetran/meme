# MemeKit

*An elegant meme tool for a more civilized age.*

This is an effort to rebuild [Meme-Gen](https://github.com/vancetran/meme-gen) to be more modular and themeable. Also, it's a great ~~excuse~~ opportunity to learn Angular and Snap.svg.

I'm developing in the open, so please mind the dust. Production builds are in the `gh-pages` branch and the [demo can be seen here](http://vancetran.github.io/memekit).

A fork of [CardKit](https://github.com/times/cardkit) and draws inspiration from [Vox's Meme](https://github.com/voxmedia/meme) and [Pixelcite](https://github.com/onyxfish/pixelcite).
